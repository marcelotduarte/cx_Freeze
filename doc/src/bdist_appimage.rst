bdist_appimage
==============

An `AppImage <https://docs.appimage.org/>`_ is a downloadable file for Linux
that contains an application and everything the application needs to run
(e.g., libraries, icons, fonts, translations, etc.) that cannot be reasonably
expected to be part of each target system.

AppImages are simple to understand. Every AppImage is a regular file, and every
AppImage contains exactly one app with all its dependencies. Once the AppImage
is made executable, a user can just run it, either by double clicking it in
their desktop environmentâ€™s file manager, by running it from the console etc.

It is crucial to understand that AppImage is merely a format for distributing
applications. In this regard, AppImage is like a `.zip` file or an `.iso` file.

When cx_Freeze calls appimagetool to create an AppImage application bundle
(an :file:`.AppImage` file), it builds a read-only image of a
:ref:`cx_freeze_build_exe` directory, then prepends the runtime, and marks the
file executable.

To specify the same options on the command line, this is the help command that
shows the equivalent options:

  .. code-block:: console

    python setup.py bdist_appimage --help
