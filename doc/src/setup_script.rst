Setup script
============

cx_Freeze creates four new commands and subclasses four others to provide
the ability to build and install executables. In typical setuptools fashion
they can be provided in the setup script (it is called
``setup.py`` by convention, although it can have any name), in a
``pyproject.toml`` configuration file, in a ``setup.cfg`` configuration file,
or on the command line. They are described in detail below.

Example
-------

It looks something like this:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: pyproject.toml

      .. code-block:: toml

         [project]
         name = "guifoo"
         version = "0.1"
         description = "My GUI application!"

         [tool.cxfreeze]
         executables = [
             {script = "guifoo.py", base = "gui"}
         ]

         [tool.cxfreeze.build_exe]
         excludes = ["tkinter", "unittest"]
         zip_include_packages = ["encodings", "PySide6", "shiboken6"]

   .. group-tab:: setup.py

      .. code-block:: python

         from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

         # Dependencies are automatically detected, but they might need fine-tuning.
         build_exe_options = {
             "excludes": ["tkinter", "unittest"],
             "zip_include_packages": ["encodings", "PySide6", "shiboken6"],
         }

         setup(
             name="guifoo",
             version="0.1",
             description="My GUI application!",
             options={"build_exe": build_exe_options},
             executables=[Executable("guifoo.py", base="gui")],
         )

   .. group-tab:: setup.cfg

      Is required to pass one executable at the command line or a minimal
      ``setup.py`` for more than one executable.

      ``setup.cfg``

      .. code-block:: ini

         [metadata]
         name = guifoo
         version = 0.1
         description = My GUI application!

         [build_exe]
         excludes = tkinter,unittest
         zip_include_packages = encodings,PySide6,shiboken6

   .. group-tab:: command line

      A basic ``setup.py`` is required and the command line options overwrite
      them.

      .. code-block:: python

         from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

         build_exe_options = {
             "zip_include_packages": ["encodings", "PySide6", "shiboken6"],
         }

         setup(
             name="guifoo",
             version="0.1",
             description="My GUI application!",
             options={"build_exe": build_exe_options},
             executables=[Executable("guifoo.py", base="gui")],
         )

The script is invoked as follows:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: pyproject.toml

      .. code-block:: console

         cxfreeze build

   .. group-tab:: setup.py

      .. code-block:: console

         python setup.py build

   .. group-tab:: setup.cfg

      .. code-block:: console

         cxfreeze --script=guifoo.py --base=gui

   .. group-tab:: command line

      .. code-block:: console

         python setup.py build_exe --excludes=tkinter,unittest

.. seealso::

   :doc:`setup() keywords <keywords>`.

   :packaging:`Declaring project metadata <specifications/declaring-project-metadata/>`

   :ref:`cx_freeze_executable`

.. note:: There are more examples in the :repository:`samples
   <tree/main/samples/>` directory.

This command will create a subdirectory called ``build`` with a further
subdirectory starting with the letters ``exe.`` and ending with the typical
identifier for the platform and Python version. This allows for multiple
platforms to be built without conflicts.

To specify options in the script, use underscores in the name. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

     # ...
     zip_include_packages = ["encodings", "PySide6", "shiboken6"]

To specify the same options on the command line, use dashes, like this:

  .. code-block:: console

    python setup.py build_exe --zip-include-packages=encodings,PySide6,shiboken6

On Windows, you can build a simple installer containing all the files cx_Freeze
includes for your application, by running the setup script as:

  .. code-block:: console

    python setup.py bdist_msi

On Mac OS X, you can use ``bdist_mac`` to create a Mac application bundle or
``bdist_dmg`` to build a Mac disk image.


Commands
--------

.. _cx_freeze_build:

build
`````

This command is a standard command which has been modified by cx_Freeze to
build any executables that are defined.

.. deprecated:: 6.14
    ``build_exe`` option. Removed in version 7.0.

This is the equivalent help to specify the same options on the command line:

  .. code-block:: console

    python setup.py build --help
    Options for 'build' command:
      --build-base (-b)  base directory for build library
      (...)
      --compiler (-c)    specify the compiler type
      --help-compiler    list available compilers


.. _cx_freeze_build_exe:

or RPM packages. It can be further customized:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 200 600
   :width: 100%

   * - option name

     - build directory (where to install from); this defaults to the build_dir
       from the build command
   * - .. option:: force
     - force installation, overwriting existing files

.. _cx_freeze_executable:

cx_Freeze.Executable
--------------------

The options for the `build_exe` command are the defaults for any executables
that are created. The options for the `Executable` class allow specification of
the values specific to a particular executable. The arguments to the
constructor are as follows:

     - the name of the file containing the script which is to be frozen
   * - .. option:: init_script
     - the name of the initialization script that will be executed before the
       actual script is executed; this script is used to set up the environment
       for the executable; if a name is given without an absolute path the
       names of files in the initscripts subdirectory of the cx_Freeze package
       is searched
   * - .. option:: base
     - the name of the base executable; the pre-defined values are:

       supported; if specified a path, raise an error
   * - .. option:: icon
     - name of icon which should be included in the executable itself
       on Windows (ignored by Python app from Microsoft Store) or placed
       in the target directory for other platforms; it is recommended
       NOT to use an extension (automatically added ".ico" on Windows,
       ".icns" on macOS and ".png" or ".svg" on Linux and others)
   * - .. option:: manifest
     - name of manifest which should be included in the executable itself
       (Windows only - ignored by Python app from Microsoft Store)
   * - .. option:: uac_admin
     - creates a manifest for an application that will request elevation
       (Windows only - ignored by Python app from Microsoft Store)

   * - .. option:: shortcut_name
     - the name to give a shortcut for the executable when included in an MSI
       package (Windows only)
   * - .. option:: shortcut_dir
     - the directory in which to place the shortcut when being installed by an
       MSI package; see the MSI Shortcut table documentation for more
       information on what values can be placed here (Windows only).
   * - .. option:: copyright
     - the copyright value to include in the version resource associated with
       executable (Windows only)
   * - .. option:: trademarks
     - the trademarks value to include in the version resource associated with
       the executable (Windows only)

.. versionadded:: 6.10
    ``manifest`` and ``uac_admin`` options.

.. versionadded:: 7.0
    ``uac_uiaccess`` option.

.. versionchanged:: 6.5
