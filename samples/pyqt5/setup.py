"""A simple setup script to create an executable using PyQt5. This also
demonstrates the method for creating a Windows executable that does not have
an associated console.

test_pyqt5.py is a very simple type of PyQt5 application

Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'

If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the application
