"""A simple setup script to create an executable using PySide6. This also
demonstrates how to use excludes to get minimal package size.

test_qml.py is a very simple type of PySide6 application.

Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'

If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the application.
