"""A very simple setup script to create a single executable, and test the
BUILD_CONSTANTS functionality.

hello.py is a very simple 'Hello, world' type script which also displays
certains constants stored in BUILD_CONSTANTS.

Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'

If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the script without Python"""
