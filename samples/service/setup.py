"""
A simple setup script for creating a Windows service.
See the comments in the Config.py and ServiceHandler.py files for more
information on how to set this up.

Installing the service is done with the option --install <Name> and
uninstalling the service is done with the option --uninstall <Name>. The
value for <Name> is intended to differentiate between different invocations
of the same service code -- for example for accessing different databases or
using different configuration files.
