"""
A simple setup script to create an executable using PySide2. This also
demonstrates how to use excludes to get minimal package size.

PySide2app.py is a very simple type of PySide2 application

Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'

If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the application
